Known Bugs
=======

1. Playlist Bug. First open a playlist, then navigate away from it, then
drag a stream into that previously opened playlist via the playlist's thumbnail.
The main view gets populated with tracks of that playlist.

2. When switched to streaming mode, loop doesn't work. Also some tracks don't play.
